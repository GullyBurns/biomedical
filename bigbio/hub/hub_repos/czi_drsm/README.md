# Dataset Card for CZI DRSM

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/DRSM-corpus
- **Pubmed:** False
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** TXTCLASS

Research article document classification dataset based on aspects of disease research. Currently, the dataset consists of three subsets: (A) classifies title/abstracts of papers into most popular subtypes of clinical, basic, and translational papers (~20k papers); (B) identifies whether a title/abstract of a paper describes substantive research into Quality of Life (~10k papers); (C) identifies if a paper is a natural history study (~10k papers). These classifications are particularly relevant in rare disease research, a field that is generally understudied.
